        <h1>“A Drifter in Harmony”</h1> 

 

<p><em>Harmony Virginia 8:45am Lake Miskwà State Park</em>  

 <br>
 <br>

“It was the park ranger who called it in this morning.” 
<br> 
The deputy leaned into the driver’s side window, his forearm resting on the hood while he briefed the Sheriff.  
<br> 

“Who Coleman? Thought he was out on leave for gout or some bullshit.” said the Sheriff, trying to assess all the places his coffee had spilled during the quaky drive there.  
<br> 
“No, it was Rosa. She’s fairly new. Anyway, she’s down by the lake right now holding off the visitors til we can take a look at the scene for ourselves.”  
<br> 

As the Sheriff hopped out of his jeep, he checked the door one last time. The worn-out seatbelt was always catching. Too many times he’d been spotted driving through town with that gnarled tan strap flapping in the wind outside his door. He joined his deputy by the trail head.  

<br> 
“I guess no one found a body yet or else you would have led with that right Hopkins?” 
<br> 
The Sheriff asked almost optimistically as they stumbled down the rough wooded trail. His deputy sighed ominously. 
<br> "No, but they seem to have found...everything else." 
<br> The Sheriff said nothing more, only gave a slight nod of morbid understanding. The deputy continued to lead the way with nervous expectant energy. Their path ran parallel with a creek still swollen from rain. Recent flooding left a fall-out of debris that studded the narrow trail like rhinestones with rocks and broken branches that bit at their shins and ankles with each step.  

The creek trail would eventually lead them onto the shallow silt shore of the massive Lake Miskwà, where a young, alert park ranger met them. There was an active looking chocolate lab at her side trying his best to sit still.  

<br> “Morning Miss... Anzu...Anzules?"  

<br> "'Rosa' will do Sheriff" <br> The ranger said, politely rescuing her name once again from the grip of southern mispronunciation. She led them along the tree line to a secluded section of the shore. It was at this point that her dog ceased to follow them. He sat some yards back, upright like a sphinx, and with the faintest rumble of a growl. Hopkins knelt facing the dog, patting his knees. <br> “Come on boy, this way.” <br> The dog simply lay down, fixing his eyes on the surface of the water as if some unseen enemy might spring from beneath its leaf-littered surface at any moment. Rosa put a hand on his shoulder. <br> “It’s no use, Duke doesn’t go any further than this spot.” <br> She scratched her dog reassuringly behind the ears and looked up at the Sheriff. <br> “And neither do I.” 

She handed the sheriff a small name tag fixed to a wire clip. It was an old ski pass from the year before to a resort 2 miles away. 

<br> “Duke (the dog) found this along the trail and followed the scent here. His name is Avi Ansari, 23. He told me he was some kind of amateur nature photographer...birds mostly. He rented one of our tent spaces 3 days ago, packed up his camp but never checked out.” 

 She motioned to the section of shore to her left. After some questioning glances the two officers headed over on their own.  

Not a word passed between the two men for some time. It was as if the gravity of the scene before them had pulled them in completely. They were knelt by what appeared to be a large section of the ground that had been burned, or rather scorched. It formed a radial pattern roughly the size of a kitty pool that glittered in the morning sun with irregular chunks of dark glass scattered throughout. Leading away from this spot was a distinct impression in the gray clay silt that ended a few yards at a backpack, abandoned by the water’s edge. These were the only traces they had of what would be their fifth missing hiker in as many months around Lake Miskwà. 

For most people, DeJa'Vu is just a quaint French phrase to describe a whimsical coincidence. For these men DeJa'Vu was a ghost that haunted each new disappearance with an ill-humored familiarity. 

The Sheriff broke the silence. 
<br>  

“Tell me Hopkins, about how many people would you say get struck by lightning each year in this country?” 
<br> 

 The deputy was snapping photos of the scene from every angle and never looked up.
 <br> 

“Probably no more than 300 with even fewer fatalities I’d imagine.” 
<br> 

The Sheriff made his way over to him. 
<br> 

“And I’m willing to bet there ain’t a place on Earth where lightning has ever caused someone to vanish in thin air.”  
<br> 

All Hopkins could do was shrug his shoulders. This was becoming a common sight, no matter how uncommon the circumstances.  

The Sheriff examined the backpack. One of the straps was ripped off. The other partially cut with a serrated edge. He spotted large, deep footprints moving away from the pack in the direction of the burn. 

<br> “He was dragged to this point but managed to cut himself free with a short blade. Maybe a 2-inch pocketknife.” 

<br> Hopkins brought his camera closer to the prints in the clay. 
<br> 

“Something sure scared the hell out of him. These prints face the water once and then haul ass in the opposite direction. But hold on...” <br> 
He laid his camera down, lined his feet up parallel with the impressions and got down on both knees. He looked up at the Sheriff with a look of silent confirmation. 
<br> 
“Don’t tell me this one was tall too.” <br> 
The Sheriff sighed and shook his head in disbelief. 
<br> 

“This fella had to be 6.3 or 6.5 easy, based on how long his shins are.” Hopkins replied excitedly.  
<br> 
His deputy smiled at this, but then lowered his camera to look at the Sheriff. 
<br> 

“You know the chatter back at the office is that we might have some kind of drifter picking these people off. You know...like a serial killer.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff smiled and shook his head. 
<br> 
“You deputies gossip like church ladies. Come on Hopkins, that’s only slightly less likely than lightning. No, unless a body washes up along Miskwà I’m not getting Quantico involved just yet.” 
<br> 
He slipped a few chunks of the glass into a small paper envelope which he placed in his inside coat pocket. 
<br> 
“But who or what could drag a 6 ft tall man with gear and a knife down to the water and leave no footprints themselves?”  
<br> 
The Sheriff shot him an expectant stare, like a professor waiting for the class to answer. 
<br> 
“I know Sheriff. I know. Don’t ask questions until the scene is finished speaking." 
<br> 
They recited together like a nursery rhyme. 

<br>   

“Very good. When we’re done here, I’ve gotta head over to the plant construction site. They had some vandalism last night, and maybe some theft.” 
<br> 
Hopkins looked up at him perplexed.  
<br> 
“Why not send one of the other deputies? You know these kids...back home from their big college towns; all just horny, bored, and reckless.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff sighed, turning back in the direction of the trail.  
<br> 
“No doubt you’re right, but you know this plant is the Mayor’s campaign promise. That means I get to personally inspect broken windows and anarchy symbols drawn in lipstick on bathroom mirrors.  Anyway, I’ll let you know if anything new turns up.” 
<br> 
<br> 
 

 

<em> Harmony Virginia September 22nd 2023  

 population 8,665 

Later that morning.. </em>

<br> 
<br> 
 

“All these hiking nuts come here chasing fall colors. They have no idea they’re trotting on graves.”  
<br> 
Edison scoffed bitterly while watching the unbroken line of seasonal traffic snake its way down route 20 through the half-open shutters.  His granddaughter, Alex, was doing inventory behind the bar failing to tune him out. She was taking the semester off and helping at her grandfather’s bar. They’d already debated that morning about her purple hair and ‘distracting’ piercings.  
<br> 
“You’re always so pissy when tourist season hits. We need them Ed. Try not to bum hikers out this year with dead minor stories.”  
<br> 
He abandoned the window, sat at the bar and lit his pipe seemingly disregarding her presence.  
<br> 
“When a town has history folks should know about it.” 
<br> 
Harmony certainly had its history. Mines left deep scars across the Appalachian landscape; exposed cliff faces eroded by wind and neglect, mountain peaks with leveled, bald tops, ash gray with upturned gravel and barren of trees. However, it was the mines themselves that will forever linger in the memory of any townsperson old enough to remember them. “Tragedy in Harmony” the old 1950’s newspapers read with dark-humored irony. When all was said and done it took 10 cave-ins and the lives of 41 minors before the government finally stepped in and declared the sites ‘unfit for operation.’ For nearly a decade the town stagnated in economic ruin. So, when the country’s first nuclear reactor appeared just 200 miles away, the town’s newly elected Mayor leaped at the opportunity.  
<br> 
<br> 
 

<em>12:30pm Groundbreaking ceremony Miskwà Lake Power Station</em> 
<br> 
<br> 
 

Reporter 1 - “Do you think Harmony is fiscally ready for a project like this?” 
<br> 
“Well, I believe that question was put on a ballot just last year and here we are. It’s been more than 60 years since my grandfather, the late Mayor Jefferey Holmes, gifted this town with its own nuclear power plant. It brought jobs, clean energy, and most importantly, a second chance. The town of Harmony is a story of reinvention and it’s time to re-invent again.   
<br> 
“I believe we have time for one more question.” The mayor chimed in with a modest attempt at moderating the press. The crowd is an undulating chorus of reporters sparring for the chance to throw out questions.  
<br> 
Reporter 2 – “Dr. Holmes, how can you be so confident that your plant will be fully operational by the end of the year when your own colleagues argue that sustained nuclear fusion reactors probably won’t even be possible for another 30 years?” 
<br> 
The question seems to pacify the crowd under the weight of their own curiosity. Dr. Holmes’ smile widened. 
<br> 
“Right to the point, I like that. It’s true, I spend a lot less time in the lab and more time at press conferences. My colleagues are right to have their doubts. Conventional particle physics presents unavoidable, inherent limitations to generating a fusion reaction. We are trying to replicate conditions that only occur in the center of the sun. We are tempting the physics of stars in the backyard of our humble one post office town of Harmony, Virginia.” 
<br> 
Holmes’s unshakeable Southern drawl added a comical charm to his eloquent delivery of nuclear physics 101 to reporters. He was a likeable, charismatic figure; a living mascot for the company and he was quickly becoming the face of the future of nuclear power itself.   
<br> 
“In basic terms we are forcing together subatomic particles that by divine design repel each other. In a confined space under unfathomable heat the particles will fuse, and this brief interaction will generate an absurd amount of energy.” 
<br> 
He moved his hands as he spoke in an almost choreographed way. It was as if the audience of journalists were a choir he was directing, and they were. What he was attempting was radical, but he knew the more attention he got the more legitimate the project would appear. So, it was on that clear Autumn afternoon the good doctor would go fishing...for public approval. He continued... 
<br> 
“At the same time, we need to contain that energy without vaporizing the glasses off every Ivy-league alum in the control room. Believe it or not, raw energy isn’t that useful. You can’t just plug your cell phone into lightning. We need a process to convert all this cosmic power into a form that’ll play nice with our homes, office buildings, and pizza shops.”  
<br> 
He paused a moment. Ever the dramatists, this was the part he wanted to bring home, staring into one reporter’s eyes as if she were the camera. 
<br> 
“We have found that process!” 
<br> 
The Sheriff listened to the doctor speak with the keenest interest, not in the subject matter, which was a little over his head, but in studying the faces of the other board members present. The mayor asked him to make an appearance as a show of community support, not for any official police business. That, of course, didn’t stop him from taking in the sights so to speak. 

He recollected how subdued the other members present seemed at the time, a shared look on their faces of suppressed anxiety. It wasn’t obvious. It was there and gone, the way you only catch the glimpse of a shooting star out of the corner of your eye and never straight on. Today he was just here for the groundbreaking ceremony, but he had an unshakeable feeling that he’d be back, speaking to them behind closed doors about the things they saw out of the corners of their eyes but couldn’t speak of. 
<br> 
<br> 
 

<em>Two Years later....</em> 

<br> 
<br> 

 

The plant was finally up and running (though still in the research phase) and it needed workers to fill it. One man was particularly excited to get a call from the staffing agency in town. Victor, a former mechanic, had been out of work for months after the owner sold the business (to settle gambling debts according to the other mechanics). He remembered the signed HR form on his kitchen table said he would be a “Coolant Supply Engineer I.” He only had the vaguest idea of what the title meant, but the agency assured him that he was what they were looking for. 
<br> 
“Well Vick, they’re looking for mechanics and engineers of all backgrounds, and the pay looks pretty good,” the fast-talking agency rep said over the phone. 
<br> 
“If you can tighten a bolt and follow directions, they want to talk to you.” 
<br> 
Of course, Victor had far more experience than that. Back home he and his cousin repurposed old or “found” car parts. He had a working knowledge of 9 different engine layouts across more than thirty models by the time he was 17. This same hobby that would nearly get him deported as a teenager could now be “repurposed” for providing clean energy to citizens of Harmony and 6 neighboring counties. He had grown up, and with a new wedding ring on his finger he was a model employee. He wore his ID badge proudly every day to work. “Engineer I” it read. Perhaps someday he would go back to school and become a real engineer with the blessings of the company. Of course, he thought that’s if they don’t let him go first for being crazy. 

Now just two hours into his shift the Sheriff is sitting across from him at a cold metal table in the break room. He is looking at him with the same expression of sympathy and disbelief that his supervisor had just hours earlier, but for a completely different reason. 

The Sheriff pulled a small voice recorder from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of him. 
<br> 
“I’m not going to turn this on just yet, because you and me need to get to know each other first.” 
<br> 
Victor let out a nervous laugh. 
<br> 
“What is this about? I already gave a statement.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff pulled out the statement and placed it on the table with care, almost daintily. 
<br> 
“And I read every word of it. I just want to understand what it all means. All this technical jargon...I’m a simple, country law man. Just tell me if I have my facts straight.” 
<br> 
Victor shifted in his chair nervously. The Sheriff pretended not to notice. 
<br> 
“Now they tell me that you were directly responsible for halting a pretty, major experiment this morning just as it was about to get underway. They all seem pretty sore about that Mr...um...hmm.” The Sheriff gave a brief look of surprise at the paper but then quickly recovered. 
<br> 
“Anzules! Of course, Mr. Anzules I meant to say. Did I say it right?” 
<br> 
Victor gave a surprised smile.  
<br> 
“Yes, you said it perfectly. No one ever does out here.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff’s jovial smile faded seamlessly into a blank expression. 
<br> 
“What happened in that chamber this morning? You’re one of the safety officers I hear. That means you have every authority to stop the operation if things go south. Either you saw something the others didn’t, or you sensed something they couldn’t.” 
<br> 
Victor broke eye contact again and stared at the recorder. 
<br> 
“Shouldn’t you start the recorder?” 

<br> 
The Sheriff loosened his tie and leaned back in the chair. 
<br> 
“Good man. Not yet, we’ll get to that. Now speak son.” 
<br> 
He rubbed his hands on his knees, sighed deeply, and began his story from the beginning. 
<br> 
“Today’s experiment was basically a dress rehearsal for a full run...that’s where we initiate a full reaction cycle and measure the energy output at the end. There are three safety officers stationed along the control tower during experiments.” 
<br> 
“Why three?” The Sheriff interrupted. 
<br> 
“Three different vantage points, above, below, and near testing level. That way we can ensure that the testing grounds are clear. I was at testing level monitoring the temperature when I spotted someone on the bridge. The area should’ve been clear. The doors were already locked and pressurized. That area would essentially be a vacuum. Best case scenario they’d suffocate before we can get them out.” 
<br> 
“And the worst case?” 
<br> 
“If the reaction started with him inside you mean? He’d be vaporized...literally. Every molecule he owned would be reduced to ions before his eyes could even squint from the glare.”   
<br> 
“Sweet mercy! Well, that’s no room I wanna be in. This is the same process the power station is going to run off of full time? 
<br> 
“No, today’s experiment took place in the bolt chamber. It’s testing Dr. Holmes’s own theoretical method. He calls it Project Zeus.” 
<br> 
“After the God of...lightning.” He raised an eyebrow at this. “My my, how you science folks are into mythology. What’s that all about.” 
<br> 
“I don’t really know all the details, but from what I understand they’re trying to recreate the conditions that produce lightning. An electrostatic generator 
<br> 
“I’ve heard of that...like those big steel balls at the county fair that make your hair stand on end’” 
<br> 
“utilizing lightning to intiate nuclear fusion 
<br> 
<br> 
 

<b>NEW EDIT</b>
<br> 
<br>  

Alright you got me, what’s lighting have to do with nuclear fusion? 
<br> 
Sheriff – you may not believe me or even understand but it’s this lightning that I’m most interested in and I believe you are just the kind of plain talking fella to explain it to me in a way that I can wrap my head around. 

Well, you know how Dr. Holmes says we’re “playing with the science of stars?” That’s not quite accurate. While conventional research methods at achieving fusion do reach those temperatures the amount of effort to get it there really isn’t sustainable. Since lightning is the only other known form in which nuclear fusion is observed in nature, Holmes thought he could just as easily start there. 

“Is that right?” 

“Yes, but of course at a much smaller scale and at temperatures many hundreds of thousands of degrees cooler. What minuscule fusion takes place is here and gone in a flash” 

“That clever son of a bitch! That’s why he’s so confident in the timeline of his process, no one else is even studying it. He solved his own riddle; how do you hold onto lightning...you make it.” 

Pardon my saying, but you seem to know a lot about it for someone who is not quite in the loop. 

Vik – I want to be an engineer eventually and this project is bigger than anything I’d ever learn about in trade school. Ironically the only reason I’m even allowed to participate is because of my minimal role in the project. They thought I wouldn’t be in the way, and yet..” 

“And yet..don’t sell yourself short. I need you.” 

The Sheriff picked the recorder up and played with it in his hand. 

“I didn’t bring this to record you. I wanted you to hear something. 

You know at the beginning of last year my deputies, and I were investigating missing hikers, one after the other. Five people went missing over a period of five months and then, nothing. Just like the hikers, all reports of missing people stopped as well. 

Now, a brand-new year and what do you think I’m doing? Chasing ghosts. Vandalism, trespassing, petty theft, and a lot of blurry images on security cameras. At first, we thought it was a bunch of worthless townies, or some wannabe gang living out their hick town ideas of what West Coast gangs do. But no cash was ever stolen. There was no graffiti tagging or late-night parking lot brawls to report. No sir, we’ve had hardware store break-ins where $200 worth of extension cords and a gas-powered generator disappear and re-appear hours later covered in red dirt. Then I found out that a team of engineers can’t report to the plant because the $30,000 electric security gate won’t open. Now today, a major experiment is stalled. It all goes back to this plant and now this project.

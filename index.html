        <h1>“A Drifter in Harmony”</h1> 

 

<p><em>Harmony Virginia 8:45am Lake Miskwà State Park</em>  

 <br>
 <br>

“It was the park ranger who called it in this morning.” 
<br> 
The deputy leaned into the driver’s side window, his forearm resting on the hood while he briefed the Sheriff.  
<br> 

“Who Coleman? Thought he was out on leave for gout or some bullshit.” said the Sheriff, trying to assess all the places his coffee had spilled during the quaky drive there.  
<br> 
“No, it was Rosa. She’s fairly new. Anyway, she’s down by the lake right now holding off the visitors til we can take a look at the scene for ourselves.”  
<br> 

As the Sheriff hopped out of his jeep, he checked the door one last time. The worn-out seatbelt was always catching. Too many times he’d been spotted driving through town with that gnarled tan strap flapping in the wind outside his door. He joined his deputy by the trail head.  

<br> 
“I guess no one found a body yet or else you would have led with that right Hopkins?” 
<br> 
The Sheriff asked almost optimistically as they stumbled down the rough wooded trail. His deputy sighed ominously. 
<br> "No, but they seem to have found...everything else." 
<br> The Sheriff said nothing more, only gave a slight nod of morbid understanding. The deputy continued to lead the way with nervous expectant energy. Their path ran parallel with a creek still swollen from rain. Recent flooding left a fall-out of debris that studded the narrow trail like rhinestones with rocks and broken branches that bit at their shins and ankles with each step.  

The creek trail would eventually lead them onto the shallow silt shore of the massive Lake Miskwà, where a young, alert park ranger met them. There was an active looking chocolate lab at her side trying his best to sit still.  

<br> “Morning Miss... Anzu...Anzules?"  

<br> "'Rosa' will do Sheriff" <br> The ranger said, politely rescuing her name once again from the grip of southern mispronunciation. She led them along the tree line to a secluded section of the shore. It was at this point that her dog ceased to follow them. He sat some yards back, upright like a sphinx, and with the faintest rumble of a growl. Hopkins knelt facing the dog, patting his knees. <br> “Come on boy, this way.” <br> The dog simply lay down, fixing his eyes on the surface of the water as if some unseen enemy might spring from beneath its leaf-littered surface at any moment. Rosa put a hand on his shoulder. <br> “It’s no use, Duke doesn’t go any further than this spot.” <br> She scratched her dog reassuringly behind the ears and looked up at the Sheriff. <br> “And neither do I.” 

She handed the sheriff a small name tag fixed to a wire clip. It was an old ski pass from the year before to a resort 2 miles away. 

<br> “Duke (the dog) found this along the trail and followed the scent here. His name is Avi Ansari, 23. He told me he was some kind of amateur nature photographer...birds mostly. He rented one of our tent spaces 3 days ago, packed up his camp but never checked out.” 

 She motioned to the section of shore to her left. After some questioning glances the two officers headed over on their own.  

Not a word passed between the two men for some time. It was as if the gravity of the scene before them had pulled them in completely. They were knelt by what appeared to be a large section of the ground that had been burned, or rather scorched. It formed a radial pattern roughly the size of a kitty pool that glittered in the morning sun with irregular chunks of dark glass scattered throughout. Leading away from this spot was a distinct impression in the gray clay silt that ended a few yards at a backpack, abandoned by the water’s edge. These were the only traces they had of what would be their fifth missing hiker in as many months around Lake Miskwà. 

For most people, DeJa'Vu is just a quaint French phrase to describe a whimsical coincidence. For these men DeJa'Vu was a ghost that haunted each new disappearance with an ill-humored familiarity. 

The Sheriff broke the silence. 
<br>  

“Tell me Hopkins, about how many people would you say get struck by lightning each year in this country?” 
<br> 

 The deputy was snapping photos of the scene from every angle and never looked up.
 <br> 

“Probably no more than 300 with even fewer fatalities I’d imagine.” 
<br> 

The Sheriff made his way over to him. 
<br> 

“And I’m willing to bet there ain’t a place on Earth where lightning has ever caused someone to vanish in thin air.”  
<br> 

All Hopkins could do was shrug his shoulders. This was becoming a common sight, no matter how uncommon the circumstances.  

The Sheriff examined the backpack. One of the straps was ripped off. The other partially cut with a serrated edge. He spotted large, deep footprints moving away from the pack in the direction of the burn. 

<br> “He was dragged to this point but managed to cut himself free with a short blade. Maybe a 2-inch pocketknife.” 

<br> Hopkins brought his camera closer to the prints in the clay. 
<br> 

“Something sure scared the hell out of him. These prints face the water once and then haul ass in the opposite direction. But hold on...” <br> 
He laid his camera down, lined his feet up parallel with the impressions and got down on both knees. He looked up at the Sheriff with a look of silent confirmation. 
<br> 
“Don’t tell me this one was tall too.” <br> 
The Sheriff sighed and shook his head in disbelief. 
<br> 

“This fella had to be 6.3 or 6.5 easy, based on how long his shins are.” Hopkins replied excitedly.  
<br> 
His deputy smiled at this, but then lowered his camera to look at the Sheriff. 
<br> 

“You know the chatter back at the office is that we might have some kind of drifter picking these people off. You know...like a serial killer.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff smiled and shook his head. 
<br> 
“You deputies gossip like church ladies. Come on Hopkins, that’s only slightly less likely than lightning. No, unless a body washes up along Miskwà I’m not getting Quantico involved just yet.” 
<br> 
He slipped a few chunks of the glass into a small paper envelope which he placed in his inside coat pocket. 
<br> 
“But who or what could drag a 6 ft tall man with gear and a knife down to the water and leave no footprints themselves?”  
<br> 
The Sheriff shot him an expectant stare, like a professor waiting for the class to answer. 
<br> 
“I know Sheriff. I know. Don’t ask questions until the scene is finished speaking." 
<br> 
They recited together like a nursery rhyme. 

<br>   

“Very good. When we’re done here, I’ve gotta head over to the plant construction site. They had some vandalism last night, and maybe some theft.” 
<br> 
Hopkins looked up at him perplexed.  
<br> 
“Why not send one of the other deputies? You know these kids...back home from their big college towns; all just horny, bored, and reckless.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff sighed, turning back in the direction of the trail.  
<br> 
“No doubt you’re right, but you know this plant is the Mayor’s campaign promise. That means I get to personally inspect broken windows and anarchy symbols drawn in lipstick on bathroom mirrors.  Anyway, I’ll let you know if anything new turns up.” 
<br> 
<br> 
 

 

<em> Harmony Virginia September 22nd 2023  

 population 8,665 

Later that morning.. </em>

<br> 
<br> 
 

“All these hiking nuts come here chasing fall colors. They have no idea they’re trotting on graves.”  
<br> 
Edison scoffed bitterly while watching the unbroken line of seasonal traffic snake its way down route 20 through the half-open shutters.  His granddaughter, Alex, was doing inventory behind the bar failing to tune him out. She was taking the semester off and helping at her grandfather’s bar. They’d already debated that morning about her purple hair and ‘distracting’ piercings.  
<br> 
“You’re always so pissy when tourist season hits. We need them Ed. Try not to bum hikers out this year with dead minor stories.”  
<br> 
He abandoned the window, sat at the bar and lit his pipe seemingly disregarding her presence.  
<br> 
“When a town has history folks should know about it.” 
<br> 
Harmony certainly had its history. Mines left deep scars across the Appalachian landscape; exposed cliff faces eroded by wind and neglect, mountain peaks with leveled, bald tops, ash gray with upturned gravel and barren of trees. However, it was the mines themselves that will forever linger in the memory of any townsperson old enough to remember them. “Tragedy in Harmony” the old 1950’s newspapers read with dark-humored irony. When all was said and done it took 10 cave-ins and the lives of 41 minors before the government finally stepped in and declared the sites ‘unfit for operation.’ For nearly a decade the town stagnated in economic ruin. So, when the country’s first nuclear reactor appeared just 200 miles away, the town’s newly elected Mayor leaped at the opportunity.  
<br> 
<br> 
 

<em>12:30pm Groundbreaking ceremony Miskwà Lake Power Station</em> 
<br> 
<br> 
 

Reporter 1 - “Do you think Harmony is fiscally ready for a project like this?” 
<br> 
“Well, I believe that question was put on a ballot just last year and here we are. It’s been more than 60 years since my grandfather, the late Mayor Jefferey Holmes, gifted this town with its own nuclear power plant. It brought jobs, clean energy, and most importantly, a second chance. The town of Harmony is a story of reinvention and it’s time to re-invent again.   
<br> 
“I believe we have time for one more question.” The mayor chimed in with a modest attempt at moderating the press. The crowd is an undulating chorus of reporters sparring for the chance to throw out questions.  
<br> 
Reporter 2 – “Dr. Holmes, how can you be so confident that your plant will be fully operational by the end of the year when your own colleagues argue that sustained nuclear fusion reactors probably won’t even be possible for another 30 years?” 
<br> 
The question seems to pacify the crowd under the weight of their own curiosity. Dr. Holmes’ smile widened. 
<br> 
“Right to the point, I like that. It’s true, I spend a lot less time in the lab and more time at press conferences. My colleagues are right to have their doubts. Conventional particle physics presents unavoidable, inherent limitations to generating a fusion reaction. We are trying to replicate conditions that only occur in the center of the sun. We are tempting the physics of stars in the backyard of our humble one post office town of Harmony, Virginia.” 
<br> 
Holmes’s unshakeable Southern drawl added a comical charm to his eloquent delivery of nuclear physics 101 to reporters. He was a likeable, charismatic figure; a living mascot for the company and he was quickly becoming the face of the future of nuclear power itself.   
<br> 
“In basic terms we are forcing together subatomic particles that by divine design repel each other. In a confined space under unfathomable heat the particles will fuse, and this brief interaction will generate an absurd amount of energy.” 
<br> 
He moved his hands as he spoke in an almost choreographed way. It was as if the audience of journalists were a choir he was directing, and they were. What he was attempting was radical, but he knew the more attention he got the more legitimate the project would appear. So, it was on that clear Autumn afternoon the good doctor would go fishing...for public approval. He continued... 
<br> 
“At the same time, we need to contain that energy without vaporizing the glasses off every Ivy-league alum in the control room. Believe it or not, raw energy isn’t that useful. You can’t just plug your cell phone into lightning. We need a process to convert all this cosmic power into a form that’ll play nice with our homes, office buildings, and pizza shops.”  
<br> 
He paused a moment. Ever the dramatists, this was the part he wanted to bring home, staring into one reporter’s eyes as if she were the camera. 
<br> 
“We have found that process!” 
<br> 
The Sheriff listened to the doctor speak with the keenest interest, not in the subject matter, which was a little over his head, but in studying the faces of the other board members present. The mayor asked him to make an appearance as a show of community support, not for any official police business. That, of course, didn’t stop him from taking in the sights so to speak. 

He recollected how subdued the other members present seemed at the time, a shared look on their faces of suppressed anxiety. It wasn’t obvious. It was there and gone, the way you only catch the glimpse of a shooting star out of the corner of your eye and never straight on. Today he was just here for the groundbreaking ceremony, but he had an unshakeable feeling that he’d be back, speaking to them behind closed doors about the things they saw out of the corners of their eyes but couldn’t speak of. 
<br> 
<br> 
 

<em>Two Years later....</em> 

<br> 
<br> 

 

The plant was finally up and running (though still in the research phase) and it needed workers to fill it. One man was particularly excited to get a call from the staffing agency in town. Victor, a former mechanic, had been out of work for months after the owner sold the business (to settle gambling debts according to the other mechanics). He remembered the signed HR form on his kitchen table said he would be a “Coolant Supply Engineer I.” He only had the vaguest idea of what the title meant, but the agency assured him that he was what they were looking for. 
<br> 
“Well Vick, they’re looking for mechanics and engineers of all backgrounds, and the pay looks pretty good,” the fast-talking agency rep said over the phone. 
<br> 
“If you can tighten a bolt and follow directions, they want to talk to you.” 
<br> 
Of course, Victor had far more experience than that. Back home he and his cousin repurposed old or “found” car parts. He had a working knowledge of 9 different engine layouts across more than thirty models by the time he was 17. This same hobby that would nearly get him deported as a teenager could now be “repurposed” for providing clean energy to citizens of Harmony and 6 neighboring counties. He had grown up, and with a new wedding ring on his finger he was a model employee. He wore his ID badge proudly every day to work. “Engineer I” it read. Perhaps someday he would go back to school and become a real engineer with the blessings of the company. Of course, he thought that’s if they don’t let him go first for being crazy. 

Now just two hours into his shift the Sheriff is sitting across from him at a cold metal table in the break room. He is looking at him with the same expression of sympathy and disbelief that his supervisor had just hours earlier, but for a completely different reason. 

The Sheriff pulled a small voice recorder from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of him. 
<br> 
“I’m not going to turn this on just yet, because you and me need to get to know each other first.” 
<br> 
Victor let out a nervous laugh. 
<br> 
“What is this about? I already gave a statement.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff pulled out the statement and placed it on the table with care, almost daintily. 
<br> 
“And I read every word of it. I just want to understand what it all means. All this technical jargon...I’m a simple, country law man. Just tell me if I have my facts straight.” 
<br> 
Victor shifted in his chair nervously. The Sheriff pretended not to notice. 
<br> 
“Now they tell me that you were directly responsible for halting a pretty, major experiment this morning just as it was about to get underway. They all seem pretty sore about that Mr...um...hmm.” The Sheriff gave a brief look of surprise at the paper but then quickly recovered. 
<br> 
“Anzules! Of course, Mr. Anzules I meant to say. Did I say it right?” 
<br> 
Victor gave a surprised smile.  
<br> 
“Yes, you said it perfectly. No one ever does out here.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff’s jovial smile faded seamlessly into a blank expression. 
<br> 
“What happened in that chamber this morning? You’re one of the safety officers I hear. That means you have every authority to stop the operation if things go south. Either you saw something the others didn’t, or you sensed something they couldn’t.” 
<br> 
Victor broke eye contact again and stared at the recorder. 
<br> 
“Shouldn’t you start the recorder?” 

<br> 
The Sheriff loosened his tie and leaned back in the chair. 
<br> 
“Good man. Not yet, we’ll get to that. Now speak son.” 
<br> 
He rubbed his hands on his knees, sighed deeply, and began his story from the beginning. 
<br> 
“Today’s experiment was basically a dress rehearsal for a full run...that’s where we initiate a full reaction cycle and measure the energy output at the end. There are three safety officers stationed along the control tower during experiments.” 
<br> 
“Why three?” The Sheriff interrupted. 
<br> 
“Three different vantage points, above, below, and near testing level. That way we can ensure that the testing grounds are clear. I was at testing level monitoring the temperature when I spotted someone on the bridge. The area should’ve been clear. The doors were already locked and pressurized. That area would essentially be a vacuum. Best case scenario they’d suffocate before we can get them out.” 
<br> 
“And the worst case?” 
<br> 
“If the reaction started with him inside you mean? He’d be vaporized...literally. Every molecule he owned would be reduced to ions before his eyes could even squint from the glare.”   
<br> 
“Sweet mercy! Well, that’s no room I wanna be in." 
<br>
“Exactly! I hit the alarm, got on the radio to the other officers about what I saw and...” 
<br>
The Sheriff interrupted. 
<br>
“And he was gone...a 6’5”tall, handsome, Middle Eastern-looking fellow of college age, and no one else saw him.” 
<br>
Victor gave a drawn-out sigh of frustration, shaking his head from side to side. 
<br>
“Yeah, no one else saw him.” 
<br>
The Sheriff leaned forward with a rather mischievous look on his face that Victor had trouble reading. 
<br>
“And that’s all you saw?” 
<br>
Victor slammed both fists on the table. 
<br>
“Look I saw him ok! Just as I can see you in front of me.” 
<br>
The Sheriff threw his palms out in front of him in a calming, defensive way. 
<br>
“Oh no son, you don’t understand. I believe you. I’m probably the only one in this creepy-ass building that believes every word you’ve said, but you see I think you’ve left something out of your description. I would know because I’ve heard it before.” 
<br>
The Sheriff picked up the recorder and played with it in his hand a moment as if he could sense the physical weight of what it had to say. 
<br>
“I didn’t bring this to record you, Victor. I wanted you to hear something.” 
<br>
For the next few minutes, the Sheriff played clips of a series of eyewitness interviews that he had conducted over the past year. Each interview described in detail (some more than others) the very person Victor had seen earlier that day. Victor listened intently with a mixture of validation and terror. 

When he’d listened to all of them, the Sheriff returned the recorder to his inside coat pocket, leaned back again in his chair, and folded his arms. 
<br>
“So, Victor, now that you know I don’t think you’re crazy, why don’t you go ahead and tell me the rest of it?” 
<br>
“Like what?”
<br> 
He gave that same nervous shuffle in his seat. He had no idea how noticeable his ‘tells’ were the Sheriff remembered thinking. 
<br>
‘Like tell me how you saw this guy leave the chamber. You know, I think the reason the others couldn’t see this intruder is because he didn’t leave the way he came in, and of course how could that happen in a room with only one vacuum sealed door?” 
<br>
Victor gave a sigh of reluctance and then looked the Sheriff in the eyes for the first time. 
<br>
“Because he walked through the wall.” 
<br>
The Sheriff nodded slowly and gave a slight smile at this admission. 
<br>
“And what was he carrying with him?” 
<br>
“Nothing. He didn’t have...anything.” 
<br>
Again, the Sheriff nodded approvingly, as if he were a professor trying to draw the answers out of his student, as was his way. 
<br>
“Exactly, he had nothing, and he took nothing. He merely made an appearance in front of the one person who could shut the whole thing down.” 
<br>
Victor said nothing for quite some time, merely shook his head to either side in concerned disbelief.
<br>
"Sheriff I...don't really know what to think about all this."
<br>
The Sheriff smiled and began placing the papers back in his worse for wear leather bag.
<br>
"Do you smoke Victor? That's ok, I don't either. I kinda wish we did. I think that's what people do when reality gets too unreal, they lean on their lesser vices"
<br>
The Sheriff noticed Victor's attention straying out the breakroom window to where his Supervisor and a manager were standing in the hallway, not so inconspicuously peeping in on their interview. It was at that moment the Sheriff pulled him in closer.
<br>
"Can those pricks hear us?"
<br>
"I don't think so, this room is pretty sound proof"
<br>
"Then if you want to keep your job do what I say. In 3 seconds we're both going to start laughing like we're the best of friends. We're going to stand up together, heartily shake hands, and you're going to walk me past them and into the elevator down."
<br>
They did so, and just as the imposing pair cast a curious gaze at Victor, the Sheriff remarked just loud enough for them to hear "You've really been a huge help Victor! We've been looking for this guy for some time now." 
<br>
The elevator doors closed and the Sheriff resumed business.
<br>
"I just did you a favor. Now you can earn that compliment"
<br>
"But how?"
<br>
Victor was standing with his back against the elevator, arms folded as if everything he didn't understand was slowly freezing him to death.
<br> 

For an answer the Sheriff removed the small envelope from his coat pocket containing the pieces of glass he’d found by the lake that morning and handed it to Victor. As he opened the envelope and examined the pieces a look of shock and familiarity flashed over his face. 

<br> 

 

“You’ve seen something like these before? Show me.” 

<br> 

<br> 

 

Earlier that day... 

<br> 

<br> 

 

“I’m telling you Toby, it’s gotta be military experimentation! I’m talking about off the books stuff; complete with clandestine government agents, black helicopters, and all that shit.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy, or “Theodora” to her family was even more worked up that day than deputy Hopkins was used to. She was the primary lookout at the Northern Slope fire tower. It sat on the shoulders of the highest peak like a gargoyle looking out over Harmony and the Miskwà reserve. She was something of a meteorology buff, a conspiracy theorist, and coincidentally Hopkins’s aunt. He had been concerned about her “isolation” lately. 

<br> 

 

“Alright Teddy, what’s all this about? I’ve got a lot of stops this afternoon and you aren’t exactly in the neighborhood.” 

<br> 

 

She grabbed his arm with what he always thought was an alarmingly stiff grip and led him over to a large oak table. A massive topographic map was layed out, marked in four places with little red lightning bolts. He also observed a fifth position on the map marked with a question mark. Before he could ask Teddy put her hands on his shoulders with a look of apprehensive energy. 

<br> 

 

“Have you heard anything new about the fifth hiker?” 

<br> 

 

Hopkins’s face flushed with nervous agitation as he stepped back from the table. 

<br> 

 

“Teddy, how on Earth did you hear about that?!” 

<br> 

 

Her look of concern switched in an instant to a satisfied smile. She then pulled a red colored pencil from her shirt pocket, rubbed away the odd question mark on the map with her thumb, and drew a bold lightning bolt in its place. Hopkins grabbed her hand sternly. 

<br> 

 

“Listen Teddy, this is an active missing person’s case. If you know something, then you need to...” 

<br> 

 

She silenced him with four fingers to his lips, picked up a remote control and pressed play on a CCTV monitor overhead, which she had cued up for his arrival. He sat and impatiently watched as the screen displayed 5 images at once. They were all video feeds of the valley at 1500 feet, capturing what appeared to be thunderstorms. She then froze each video at the very moment lightning had struck. Hopkins let out a frustrated sigh. 

<br> 

 

“I mean it is quite impressive that you managed to capture this footage on that outdated camera, but what does any of this have to do with the hikers?” 

<br> 

 

Agitated, she tossed the remote into his lap and wandered over to an electric kettle propped up on milk crates in the corner. 

<br> 

 

“Don’t be so two-dimensional. Look at the damn time stamps! See anything familiar?” 

<br> 

 

He did so, and after a moment he stared at Teddy in bewildered amazement.  

<br> 

 

“These clips of yours were all recorded around the times each hiker went missing.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy handed him an Oakland Raider’s mug filled with instant hot chocolate (2 packs just how he liked it). 

<br> 

 

“Those ‘outdated’ cameras outside are connected to Wi-Fi so the date and time are always current before you ask. No Toby, I think you’re looking at the very moments when those folks went missing.” 

<br> 

 

He ran his finger along the five points on the map, each corresponding to the five scenes he and the Sheriff investigated. He could still see the scorched earth in his mind; remembered that faint sulfur smell, like fresh lit July 4th sparklers. He didn’t quite know what to think at that moment, least of all what to say. Things seemed to be adding up that shouldn’t. Lightning bolts don’t abduct people. You can’t cross-examine thunderstorms.  

<br> 

 

Teddy had migrated over to one of the massive full-length widows. She was watching the last of the season’s sparrows pick at the bird seed she had left for them. In the space of that still moment, perhaps out of a desperate need for normalcy, Hopkins broke the silence. 

<br> 

 

“You know when I go to town I fill up on coffee at Minor’s Tavern. Edison asks about you.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy rolled her eyes and gave a smirk at his mischievous reflection in the window. 

<br> 

 

“He most certainly does not...grumpy ole cuss.”  

<br> 

 

She said with a comical frankness. Hopkins just laughed and shook his head.  

<br> 

 

“Well, I know he means to.” 

<br> 

 

This familiar lightness between them wouldn’t last, however. There were deep, dark questions in the air that made the sunlit tower feel overcast and haunted with significance.  

<br> 

 

“Listen Teddy, I’ll admit that these late-night flashes in the sky are a very peculiar coincidence, but are we really hinting that lightning has anything at all to do with these people disappearing?” 

<br> 

 

She shifted her eyes away from the birds to the cluster of maples in the valley below surrounding Lake Miskwà. 

<br> 

 

“I’m a batty old woman who stares at the tops of trees all day and most nights. I’ve seen hundreds of storms. They bring down trees, start floods and spark fires. It’s all nature’s cycle, of course, but there was nothing natural about that lightning on those nights.” 

<br> 

 

Hopkins perked up. 

<br> 

 

“What do you mean it won’t natural?” 

<br> 

 

She turned to look at him.  

<br> 

 

“That lightning came on its own; no wind, not a speck of rain, and my barometers barely flinched. That doesn’t happen. They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place, I don’t know how true that is, but it always strikes at least twice.” 

<br> 

 

She turned to Hopkins with a pause as if something else had just come to mind. There was a tall wooden stool at the other end of the oak table on which sat an old sugar cookie tin, the kind you see in everyone’s household, but rarely with sugar cookies in them. She gestured to him to open it. A modest pile of beautifully browned oatmeal raisin cookies was inside. Though they were more like chunks or morsels than cookies. Hopkins’s eyes widened as if he’d just found Incan treasure with Dr. Jones in the jungle. He grabbed one of the clusters, breathed in the warm cinnamon, the bitter-sweet char of butter and sugar.

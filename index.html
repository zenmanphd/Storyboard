  The deputy leaned into the driver’s side window, his forearm resting on the hood while he briefed the Sheriff. 
  
  “Well, it was the park ranger who called it in this morning.” 
  
  “Who Coleman? Thought he was out on leave for gout or some bullshit.” said the Sheriff, trying to assess all the places his coffee had spilled during the quaky drive there. 
  
  “No, it was Rosa. She’s fairly new. Anyway, she’s down by the lake right now holding off the visitors til we can take a look at the scene for ourselves.” 
  
  As the Sheriff hopped out of his jeep, he checked the door one last time. The worn-out seatbelt was always catching. Too many times he’d been spotted driving through town with that gnarled tan strap flapping in the wind outside his door. He joined his deputy by the trail head. 
  
  “I guess no one found a body yet or else you would have led with that right Hopkins?” The Sheriff asked almost optimistically as they stumbled down the rough wooded trail. His deputy sighed ominously.
  "No, but they seem to have found...everything else."
  The Sheriff said nothing more, only gave a slight nod of morbid understanding. The deputy continued to lead the way with nervous expectant energy. Their path ran parallel with a creek still swollen from rain. Recent flooding left a fall-out of debris that studded the narrow trail like rhinestones with rocks and broken branches that bit at their shins and ankles with each step.
  <br/>
  The creek trail would eventually lead them onto the shallow silt shore of the massive Lake Miskwà, where a young, alert park ranger met them. There was an active looking chocolate lab at her side trying his best to sit still. 
  
  “Morning Miss...Anzu..Anzules?"
  "'Rosa' will do Sheriff" The ranger said, politely rescuing her name from the grip of southern mispronunciation. 
  They shook hands briefly as she led them to the spot.
  
  The two officers knelt by what appeared to be a large, radial scorch mark in the silt shore overlooking the lake. It glittered in the afternoon sun with irregular chunks of dark glass scattered throughout. Leading away from this spot was a distinct shallow groove in the gray clay silt ending a few yards at a backpack abandoned by the water’s edge.

  Harmony, Virginia September 22nd 2023   
  <br/>
  
   population 8,665..? 
   <br/>
  
   
  
  “All these hiking nuts come here chasing fall colors. They have no idea they’re trotting on graves.” Edison scoffed bitterly while watching the unbroken line of seasonal traffic snake its way down route 20 through the half-open shutters.  His granddaughter, Alex, was doing inventory behind the bar failing to tune him out. She was taking the semester off and helping at her grandfather’s bar. They’d already debated that morning about her purple hair and ‘distracting’ piercings. “You’re always so pissy when tourist season hits. We need them Ed. Try not to bum hikers out this year with dead minor stories.” He abandoned the window, sat at the bar and lit his pipe seemingly disregarding her presence. “When a town has history folks should know about it.” 
  <br/>
  
  Harmony certainly had its history. Mines left deep scars across the Appalachian landscape; exposed cliff faces eroded by wind and neglect, mountain peaks with leveled, bald tops, ash gray with upturned gravel and barren of trees. However, it was the mines themselves that will forever linger in the memory of any townsperson old enough to remember them. “Tragedy in Harmony” the old 1950’s newspapers read with dark-humored irony. When all was said and done it took 10 cave-ins and the lives 41 minors before the government finally stepped in and declared the sites ‘unfit for operation.’ For nearly a decade the town stagnated in economic ruin. So, when the country’s first nuclear reactor appeared just 200 miles away, the town’s newly elected Mayor leaped at the opportunity.

  Groundbreaking ceremony Quarry Lake Power Station, Harmony 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Reporter 1 - “Do you think Harmony is fiscally ready for a project of this magnitude?” 
  <br/>
  
  “Well, I believe that question was put on a ballot just last year and here we are. It’s been more than 60 years since my grandfather, the late Mayor Jefferey Holmes, gifted this town with its own nuclear power plant. It brought jobs, clean energy, and most importantly, a second chance. The town of Harmony is a story of reinvention and it’s time to re-invent again. I have time for one more question.” 
  <br/>
  
  The crowd is an undulating chorus of reporters sparring for the chance to throw out questions. 
  <br/> 
  <br/>
  
  Reporter 2 – “Dr. Holmes, how can you be so confident that your plant will be fully operational by the end of the year when your own colleagues argue that sustained nuclear fusion reactors probably won’t even be possible for another 30 years?” 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  The question seems to pacify the crowd under the weight of their own curiosity. Dr. Holmes’ smile widened. 
  <br/>
  
  “Right to the point, I like that. It’s true, I spend a lot less time in the lab and more time at press conferences. My colleagues are right to have their doubts. Conventional particle physics presents unavoidable, inherent limitations to generating a fusion reaction. We are trying to replicate conditions that only occur in the center of the sun. We are tempting the physics of stars in the backyard of our humble one post office town of Harmony, Virginia.” 
  <br/>
  Holmes’s unshakeable Southern drawl added a comical charm to his eloquent delivery of nuclear physics 101 to reporters. He was a likeable, charismatic figure; a living mascot for the company and he was quickly becoming the face of the future of nuclear power itself.   
  <br/>
  “In basic terms we are forcing together subatomic particles that by divine design repel each other, but we’ll make them mingle. In a confined space under unfathomable heat the particles will fuse, and this brief interaction will generate an absurd amount of energy. Now, in this case heat is both the problem and the payoff. 
  <br/>
  That was the challenge...our hero’s trial; we need to somehow generate cosmic temperatures hot enough to start the reaction. At the same time, we need to contain that energy without vaporizing the glasses off every Ivy-league alum in the control room. The reality is that pure energy is no use to anybody. You can't just plug a cell phone into lightning. You need a way to dampen and direct the flow, an "in-between". And we found it out there at the bottom of that caustic, fishless lake. Out there, amidst the ecological sins of our grandfathers lies redemption in the form of a new element to science.  </p>
